# Traffic Flow State Modeling Using Markov Chains

A comprehensive traffic flow prediction system using Markov chain models and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze and predict traffic states in urban areas.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a stochastic traffic flow model that uses Markov chains to predict traffic states (Free Flow, Congested Flow, Heavy Congestion) based on various environmental factors including weather conditions, time of day, and taxi density.

## 🚀 Features

- **Markov Chain Traffic Modeling**: Implements transition matrices for different traffic states
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Uses stochastic simulations for traffic prediction
- **Environmental Factor Integration**: Considers weather, holidays, and time-of-day effects
- **Regional Traffic Analysis**: Analyzes traffic patterns across multiple taxi stands
- **Real-time Predictions**: Dynamic traffic state prediction based on current conditions
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Comprehensive plotting and analysis tools

## 🔬 Methodology

### Markov Chain Model

The traffic flow model uses a three-state Markov chain:
- **Free Flow**: Normal traffic conditions
- **Congested Flow**: Moderate traffic congestion
- **Heavy Congestion**: Severe traffic congestion

### Transition Matrix

The model adjusts transition probabilities based on:
- **Weather conditions** (Clear, Rain, Snow)
- **Time of day** (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
- **Taxi density** (Low, Medium, High)
- **Holiday effects**

### Monte Carlo Simulation

Uses stochastic simulations to estimate:
- State probabilities over time
- Steady-state distributions
- Transition probability effects
